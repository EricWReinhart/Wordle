## Project information
Implementation of the popular word-guessing game Wordle in Java. The main method calls an instance of the Wordle class, which handles all of the necessary components to make the game run properly. The user enters guesses and receives feedback on each guess until they either guess the word correctly or run out of turns.

## How to run it
For best performance, run using IntelliJ IDEA. Otherwise, do the following:
Open terminal, navigate to a location in which you are comfortable copying files, and type in the following command:
git clone https://github.com/EricWReinhart/Wordle.git
A folder named 'Wordle' should have been created. Navigate into this folder and run the following command:
gradle wrapper
Once the latter operation completes, run the command:
./gradlew run
